## üë®‚Äçüíª About
**Built by**: K Deepak  
**Purpose**: AI Agent Development Internship Application at JobYaari  
**Built in**: October 2025  
**Time to Build**: 1 day (concept to deployment)

### Why This Project?
I'm passionate about using AI to solve real-world problems and make information accessible. While researching JobYaari's AI Agent Development Internship, I identified their core challenge: automating government job notification processing. Instead of just applying with a resume, **I built the exact solution they need**.
This demonstrates my approach: **Don't just talk about skills - build working solutions**.

JobYaari's mission to simplify job notification pdf for millions of aspirants aligns perfectly with my goal to build practical, scalable AI solutions for social impact. This tool processes 250 PDFs/day at zero cost - perfect for their growth stage.
